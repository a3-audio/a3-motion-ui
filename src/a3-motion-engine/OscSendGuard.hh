/** The one way this code base aims an OSC sender.
 *
 *  The test runner calls refuseOscSenders() before any test runs. From then
 *  on connectOscSender() throws std::logic_error, whatever the host -- so a
 *  test that builds an engine without a backend, or a sender from the truth,
 *  fails instead of sending positions and pot values to the Core the truth
 *  names, the live one on the rig (#67). Every host, not only real ones: the
 *  same test then fails on every machine and with every truth, rather than
 *  only where the truth happens to name a reachable Core. There is no way
 *  back. The app never calls it, so there this only connects. */
